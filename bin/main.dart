// This class holds the number to be used to compare against its reversed form.
// To compare the two numbers, the forward version has to be able to be reversed,
// and the two numbers have to be actual raw numbers (int or double).  And to be
// able to see if the the numbers start or end in 0, then the raw numbers have to
// be able to be converted into an array of digits, or an array of characters.
// Plus, the number has to be easily incremented, or set, or maybe decremented.
// So, operators "++", "--", and "=", and "==" overloaded would be good.
// So, this class maybe should be called Ted for now, and not Digits.
